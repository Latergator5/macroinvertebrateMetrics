\usage{
calcPsi(ecologyResults, taxaList = "TL3")
}
\arguments{
\item{ecologyResults}{Dataframe with at least three columns
item{SAMPLE_ID} - unique idenftier for each sample
item{TAXON} - Taxon name that matches to macroinvertebrateTaxa dataset
item{RESULT} - Log abundance category}

\item{taxaList}{The taxonomic level the sample(s) have been identified at
according to specificed taxa lists as described in WFD100 Further
Development of River Invertebrate Classification Tool. Either "TL3" - Taxa
list 3, "TL4" - Taxa list 4 or  "TL5" - Taxa list 5.}

\description{
A sediment-sensitive macro-invertebrate metric that provides a proxy to
describe the extent to which the surface of river bed are composed, or
covered by sediments. It can be calculated at Taxonomic Levels 3, 4 & 5
